# Flare aware 🥗 *(Work in Progress)*

A recipe and meal planning app that simplifies cooking and shopping for families with different dietary needs — starting with Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis, and built to support more conditions in the future.

This project is a **work in progress** and being built with **Next.js 15**, **React 19**, **TypeScript**, **Prisma**, and **PostgreSQL**.

- 🧾 **Get nutritional values** of recipes  
  Powered by a custom food and nutrition database, not a third-party API
